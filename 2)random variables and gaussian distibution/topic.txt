statistics 
now we will dicess about randam variables in statistics.

There are two types of randam variables
they are
    discrete variables
    continuous variables

RANDOM variables

first, we will dissese about the  variables
 most of the programming languages if we we want to crete int value are float, string value we need to assine it to variable

like x= 10
x is variable and
10 is we needt to store it on variable


when we called randam variable in this also we have two types 
they are 
    discrete variables
    continuous variables

DISCRETE VARIABLES
it contains the whole number only , not a floating value.
for example :
         the no.of accounts a person has ?
         we tell like 2 or 3 not he have 2.5 accounts right 
                            (or)
         the no.of laptops the company has ?
         we tell like 500 or 550 laptops not 550.2 laptops right

CONTINUOUS VARIABLES
it contains the whole number and also floating values also
for example :
            the height of the persons in this room
            we tell like 5.1 or 5.5 or 6 right



================================================================================================================================
Gaussian distribution

- or it also called also normal distribution

formula

 x= G.D(μ, σ)
 where x is randam variable
 μ is mean
 σ is standed distribution



 in the picture we will see the graph

Empirical rule tells us that:

*Pr(μ−σ≤X≤μ+σ)=0.6827
68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.
it means 68% of the data falls within in range of 1st standard deviation ot the left side to 1st standard deviation of the right side

*Pr(μ−2σ≤X≤μ+2σ)=0.9545
95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean.

*Pr(μ−3σ≤X≤μ+3σ)=0.9973.
99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean.
